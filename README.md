## Program Retention
I worked with one of the top Universities in the Midwest to help them analyze one of their learning programs meant to help prepare late learners and students world wide for university. The University was looking to utilize their data on their students including enrollment data to analyze not just how students were progressing, but also track scholarship and any tuition discounts. Below are some of the dashboards created, which connected to an On Premises SQL Server database. Since their data was scattered across their server, we wrote queries to join and union data into tables optimized for Power BI ingestion. After publishing the reports to the online Power BI Service, I assisted in setting up their On Prem Data Gateway so that the scheduled refreshes could successfully execute against the on prem server.
